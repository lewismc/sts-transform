Project Specifics
This project serves the single purpose of
1) Reading in previously produced HTML files of the Scottish Technical Standards [1]
2) Ensure that the HTML conforms to particular XSD files published by the Scottish 
Governments Building Standards Division.  
3) If the source HTML does not then highlight where it does not and dump this to 
a single text file for analysis and correction where necessary.
4) On the other hand, if the source HTML does, begin a transformation to a fine grained
URI naming XML structure. 
5) Based on this new structure undertake named entity recognition (NER), natural language 
processing (NLP) using GATE [2] and tagging based on existing ifcXML schema definitions [3]
6) Once this has been done dump the resulting annotated XML to an XML output file
7) Finally perform another transformation on the XML which will result in an RDF/XML dump, 
this can then be used within the semantic web.
